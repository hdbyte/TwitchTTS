# Copy Pastas



**Disable TTS**
```
You think you can just flip a switch and silence the voice of the people? We sat through the fuak me spams. We endured mcquiv's moaning TTS's. We paid for your 5k couch and your door dash addiction just for the privilege of hearing our niche inside jokes echoed in a robotic monotone, and this is how you repay us? By clicking "Disable TTS" because you "couldn't focus"? PATHETIC. You aren't just muting a bot; you are muting a movement.
